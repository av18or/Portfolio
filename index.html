        My interest in programming started in the late 90's when I taught myself basic HTML, and dabled with the early versions of Javascript and Adobe Flash. My successful projects at that time were simple web sites built for friends and family out of pure enjoyment of creating something from nothing.
        <br><br>I gained further practice and experience with HTML when MySpace became popular by creating custom page layouts for anyone who wanted one.
    I then created and maintained my own personal news/blog website, focused on the topic of aviation within the state of Alaska, and successfully ran the site for several years.
   <br><br> My interest in programming comes from the sense of accomplishment I get from seeing results from before to after, and from my interest in solving problems that no one else wants to deal with.
